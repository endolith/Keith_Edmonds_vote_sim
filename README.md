This code will simulate scoring and methods to sequantially evaluate scores to get a list of winnere

There are three selection methods: 'Utilitarian','Hare_Voters' and 'Hare_Ballots' . 
These choose winners from all candidates based on the voters scores.

There are three Reweight methods: 'Unitary', 'Jefferson' and 'Allocate'.
These alter the scores between rounds based on the winner to ensure an outcome which passes the standard criteria for Proportional Representation

All combinations are possible which means that there are 9 possible models.

There is also the option of applying the KP transform to any system which means there are 18 possbile systems.

Possible Future additions:

Excess method:

This is an Approval method so it would need the KP transform

Harmonic Voting:

This like any other optimal system is likely too computationally expensive
